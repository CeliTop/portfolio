            <p>
              During this activity, I have collaborated with other students with
              other points of view, the discussions were interesting and I
              learned a lot of things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned new concepts related to climates such as radioactive
              forcing or energy budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, I now have a better view of all links between climate
              factors and what to do to limit the consequences of human
              activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, after the activity, we discussed with other groups about
              the action that can be done right now and actions that ideally
              will be accepted in a utopia. We found a lot of little actions of
              every day that everyone can do.

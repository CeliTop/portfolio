          ENSEEIHT engineers are aware of sustainable development and assist in
          conferences and activities about this subject, as well as civic
          engagement to have engineers that can be active in society and make
          changes in a positive way

              </div>
              <p>
                During these activities, I collaborated with other students with
                other points of view, the discussions were interesting and I
                learned a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                I learned new concepts related to climates such as radioactive
                forcing or energy balance. I was also able to put words on known
                or new concepts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I now have a better vision of all the links between
                climatic factors and what to do to limit the consequences of
                human activity, as well as how to be fairer and avoid being
                trapped by cognitive biases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, after the activities, we discussed with other groups
                what action can be done now and what actions will ideally be
                accepted in a utopia. {"We've"} found lots of little everyday
                actions that anyone can do.
